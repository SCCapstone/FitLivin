<p>FitLivin is a fitness application for android users that appeals to a wide variety of interest. It is not specifically geared toward any one type of training, but rather allows users to choose what type of physical progress they would like to make. The application gears its workouts to accommodate each specific user. It does not limit itself to one specific training regimen. If a teenage football player wants to gain strength and size, FitLivin will have a routine for that. If a stay-at-home mom wants to lose a few pounds in her spare time, FitLivin will have a routine tailored for her specific fitness goals. Once a workout routine has been chosen, FitLivin will give users repetitions, laps, and exercises all at the tap of a button. FitLivinâ€™s progress tracking software will allow users to track their body mass index (BMI) as they progress throughout their journey to a healthier lifestyle. We realize that this is very private information, so FitLivin will come equipped with a parse system, preventing others from snooping on our users' profiles. FitLivin recognizes that being active is only 50% of the battle when it comes to living a healthier lifestyle. That is why FitLivin will have a nutrition calculator to let users know, based on their height, weight, and goals, how many calories to consume on a daily basis. FitLivin is the only complete fitness application available that helps users with a wide range of fitness levels achieve their respective goals. It guides users not only through their physical training, but also their nutritional needs. Simply put, FitLivin is the mobile application for anyone wanting to physically better themselves in any way.</p>
