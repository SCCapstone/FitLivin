<p>FitLivin is a fitness application for android users that appeals to a wide variety of interest. It is not specifically geared toward any one type of training, but rather allows users to choose what type of physical progress they would like to make. The application gears its workouts to accommodate each specific user. It does not limit itself to one specific training regimen. If a teenage football player wants to gain strength and size, FitLivin will have a routine for that. If a stay-at-home mom wants to lose a few pounds in her spare time, FitLivin will have a routine tailored for her specific fitness goals. Once a workout routine has been chosen, FitLivin will give users repetitions, laps, and exercises all at the tap of a button. FitLivin’s progress tracking software will allow users to track their body mass index (BMI) as they progress throughout their journey to a healthier lifestyle. We realize that this is very private information, so FitLivin will come equipped with a parse system, preventing others from snooping on our users' profiles. FitLivin recognizes that being active is only 50% of the battle when it comes to living a healthier lifestyle. That is why FitLivin will have a nutrition calculator to let users know, based on their height, weight, and goals, how many calories to consume on a daily basis. FitLivin is the only complete fitness application available that helps users with a wide range of fitness levels achieve their respective goals. It guides users not only through their physical training, but also their nutritional needs. Simply put, FitLivin is the mobile application for anyone wanting to physically better themselves in any way.</p>

<p>Twenty-four year old Don really enjoys being active. He has participated in sports his entire life. A couple years ago, he graduated from Francis Marion University where he was a pitcher on the baseball team. Now he is out in the real world and has noticed that he has not been taking care of himself physically. Don enjoys being active, so he decided to start joining different seasonal teams to help him stay in shape. He plans to join a slow pitch softball team, church league basketball, and a flag football team. Also, since his younger brother has been shooting a better golf score than him, he decided to start getting out on the golf course more often.</p>

<p>GOALS: Don wants to able to train with consistent workouts geared specifically toward his different seasonal sports and track his progress to make sure that he is able to perform at the best of his ability. Our strength training program would be ideal for him to tack on a few extra yards to his drive off the tee.</p>

<p>Seventeen year old Sarah who has plenty of friends is a very athletic and social person. Sarah goes on jogs and walks every morning. She also plays soccer, swims, and is a lifeguard, so she clearly likes to stay in shape. Lately she has wanted to do a little bit more than just walking and running and wants to learn a little bit about light weight training along with her daily cardio exercises. Although she is very active, she has never really researched her BMI and doesn’t know where she stands. She would love to learn this information and store it to keep track of her progress as she begins training in the gym. However, she wouldn’t want anyone else to be able to view this very personal information seeing as she is, like most girls her age, very private about her weight. GOALS: Sarah wants to be able to keep up with her workouts and stay in shape. She also wants to be able to know when and what workouts to do during the week. She would also like her own custom user account, so she can input her weight and not have to worry about anyone seeing it.</p>
